# Using Flexbox And Grid

## Content First vs Layout First Design

One way to think about the different uses of Grid and Flexbox is to consider whether your design originates with the content, or from the overall layout. If starting with the content, and working from the smallest parts outwards, then a developer is using Content-First Design. This is a great opportunity to use Flexbox because of the flexibility it provides in manipulating code in one dimension - along either rows **or** columns.

If, however, a developer is given a specific overall layout to adhere to and needs explicit placement of elements in two dimensions, using both rows **and** columns, then Grid would be much better suited.

Content-First and Layout-First Design doesn’t mean that the developer should limit themselves to only using Flexbox or Grid individually! Let’s look at something that can happen when we attempt to create a one dimensional grid - a task many reserve for Flexbox.
